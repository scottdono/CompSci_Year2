# Function:
# 1. Write a class to represent an Item - each item has name, price and quantity.
# Include a method to calculate total price. Test your class by creating few Item objects.
# 2. Write a class to represent a complex number.
# Complex numbers can be written in the form of a+bi where a and b are real numbers and i is the solution of i^2=-1
#
# Add methods to add and subtract complex numbers - to add/subtract complex numbers you add/subtract
# the corresponding real and imaginary parts.
#
# For example, adding 1+2i and 2+3i will result in 3+5i
