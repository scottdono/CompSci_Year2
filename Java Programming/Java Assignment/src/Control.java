/*Function: 
* This tool will allow you to search for a term across a set of text sources – e.g. groups of text files.
* The user puts in a search term and the tool will check the contents of a set of text files and tell you
* which ones contain the search term. The files that have the “strongest match” against the search
* term should be returned at the top of the list.
* The user should be able to search on a single word. But to make the search better, you should be
* able to search on multiple words – e.g. “Christmas day”.. although what rules you apply as to
* whether these are assumed to be together or separate words is up to you; Maybe you can use “*”
* and logic (e.g. this word AND this word OR this word) to make the search smarter.
